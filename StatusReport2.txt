David Knopov, Chadd Yuan, Ryan , Amun #2:

(1) This week I worked on setting up the google calendar API for Practice Schedules.
I added all the practices, and races from the tufts team crew schedule. I also added a 
spreadsheet for players to log in their workouts. I, Chadd, worked on the preliminary
steps of implementing the announcemets section for the team feed page. And Ryan implemented bootstrap
and worked on a Heroku server to retrieve roster information so we dont have to store it on the website.
Amun finished the AboutUs page by incorporating the Google Maps API and researched information for the 
Lactate module such as the equation and formatting with bootstrap.


(2)
One issue I faced is figuring out how to best include the google spreadsheet of all the google calendars.
I decided to include a link at the top of the practice schedule.
Another issue we faced on the team feed page was how to design/ implement the announcements section
to allow only certain people to post and have it always show up when other people go to the page. Another
issue faced was reconciling the style elements across all of the pages. Some backgrounds seem to work well
with some pages, but make the content virtually unreadable on other pages.

(3) My goal for next week is to finish up making the calendar and spreadsheet look nice, and then tackle
another problem such as the Randomizer ( Depending on my discussion with the team next week.)
My (chadd) goal for next week is to figure out how to properly set up a true announcements section
perhaps using the server knowledge we just gained. Another goal is to finish the lactate module
and package other already implemented features into modules.
