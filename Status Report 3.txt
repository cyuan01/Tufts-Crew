Status Report 3:




 (1) what was accomplished during the week,
We got our navbar up and working and made the style better. We added a post
route to the server for blog posts and are currently trying different ways of
implementing a blog and announcements section through heroku and mongodb. We finished 
researching the lactate - watts formula as well as potential bootstrap implementations
for representing the calculator.




 (2) challenges and issues team faced during the week
 We faced issues with google map API, getting the spreadsheet to be visible by all, and some issue with our blog. We faced issues with the blog implementation;
 it might be too tricky with mongodb and creating our own interface for posting
 so we might use an api such as google blogger api and use a thrid party blogging
 interface. Another challenge the group faced was deciding on whether to implement
 a simplistic html style calculator or use bootstrap to upscale the stylistic elements
 for the lactate calculator.






 (3) your goals for the next week.
We need to finsh the randomizer, lactate, course , and team feed ( blog ) by next week. Specifically for the team feed, we need to find out how to implement a
working blog (simply a place for people to post articles): will contain author name,
date written, and content. Finish the Lactate calulator.

# Comments by Ming
* "goal for next week is to figure out how to properly set up a true announcements section" => how is this going?  This is critical.
* "working blog (simply a place for people to post articles): will contain author name," => red herring.  Why build this as there is WordPress, Drupal available?
