Project title:  Tufts Crew

Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?):

	-Sports teams, specifically Tufts Crew needs a single place for all workout, race, news, etc… information for athletes and coaches to keep track.

How do you solve the problem?:

	-A website that contains all necessary information in a well organized interface.

List of all the features that your team will implement. Your team will be held accountable for the features you list!

	-News feed, both a public and a team news feed.
	 Roster.
	- A tools section for the coaches.
	- A section for visiting teams to learn about our race course.
	- A section for coaches to schedule practice and for rowers to record results on workouts. 

What data will your prototype be using and collecting

	-News from social media feeds (instagram)
	-Information from coaches about what information will be needed


Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary

	-We’ll be using a number of simple formulas as part of a coach’s tool suite which will help them make calculations such as testing fitness levels, using lactate measurements, randomizing boats, and any other tool the coaches think would be helpful when we talk to them later this week. 
	-We’ll also be using apis from instagram, googlesheets, and possibly googlemaps.

* Good problem to solve
* Missing: *what* data will you be collecting, the information from coaches?
* You could have embedded wireframes in this README document
